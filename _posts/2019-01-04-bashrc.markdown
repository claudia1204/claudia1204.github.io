Interactive (**non-login**) shells, then the config is read from these files:

```$HOME/.bashrc```


For **login** shells, the config is read from these files:

```
/etc/profile (Always sourced)
$HOME/.bash_profile(the rest of these files are checked in order until one is found, then no others are read)
$HOME/.bash_login
$HOME/.profile
```

```~/.bash_profile``` only load once after login
