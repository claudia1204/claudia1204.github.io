Interactive (**non-login**) shells, then the config is read from these files:

```
  $HOME/.bashrc
```


For **login** shells, the config is read from these files:

```
  /etc/profile (Always sourced)
  $HOME/.bash_profile(the rest of these files are checked in order until one is found, then no others are read)
  $HOME/.bash_login
  $HOME/.profile
```

```~/.bash_profile``` only load once after login
